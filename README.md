# FaceRecognitionSystem
#### Face recognition system â€“ a multi-class classification problem
* Feature Extraction/ Selection Definition:

  The feature extraction is an essential step in any Image Patter and Recognition System. Its input is an image and its output is a feature vector. The feature selection is an optional step that aims to extract a reduced feature vector.
* Feature Extraction/ Selection Algorithm:

  a.Global)
    such as: PCA, it is a principle component analysis that used Egin values and Eign vectors.
  b.Local)
    such as: LBP, it is local binary pattern that calculate histogram of LBP code that will used as a feature vector.
* Classification Definition:
    Classification is a task to predict a class (label) of an instance.
